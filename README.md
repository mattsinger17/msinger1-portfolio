This is the public portfolio that I plan to use for the course Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About Me
My name is Matt Singer and the pronouns that I use are he, him, and his. I'm in the MPM program here at Heinz with a projected graduation in December 2019 â€” close enough to be eager, but still far away enough to have to deal with one last required core course. I've tried to maintain a focus on public and urban policy thus far in my coursework in the MPM program.

I work as the Legislative Director for the Office of City Councilman Corey O'Connor, where I specialize in policy research, analysis, and management. In this public-facing role representing the City Council office and O'Connor, I'm charged with executing special projects and legislative initiatives.
