This is the public portfolio that I plan to use for the course Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About Me
My name is Matt Singer and the pronouns that I use are he, him, and his. I'm in the MPM program here at Heinz with a projected graduation in December 2019 — close enough to be eager, but still far away enough to have to deal with one last required core course. I've tried to maintain a focus on public and urban policy thus far in my coursework in the MPM program.

I work as the Legislative Director for the Office of City Councilman Corey O'Connor, where I specialize in policy research, analysis, and management. In this public-facing role representing the City Council office and O'Connor, I'm charged with executing special projects and legislative initiatives. I brief Council Members and staff, department representatives, and external constituencies on the details of policy initiatives, including many bills that are routed through the City Council Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, which O'Connor chairs, while building, growing, and maintaining stakeholder relationships that support the successful implementation of O'Connor's and City Council's policy agenda.

I'm sure that this description of myself sounds quite boring, but I promise that I'm not a dour downer. In my spare time, I enjoy baking at home, as well as leaning into my newly-acquired brand as a millennial cat dad with my pet, Lucy, who I adopted over the winter. :cat2:

# What I Hope to Learn
Despite fairing incredibly well when dealing with dense or arcane subject matter, I've often struggled to translate that information into a highly-communicable medium like data visualization. Further complicating that situation is the reality that I'm not particularly gifted at generating aesthetically-pleasing digital content. Therefore, I think that this class will be an engaging way to develop a skill set that I've long desired: the ability to share self-made visuals for relevant projects.

I'm eager to learn the ropes of data visualization, from the basics of color theory to the more mechanical specifics of the practice. I'd like to be able to walk away from this course with the competancies necessary to plan, design, create, and share my own data visualizations for a variety of purposes, including in my professional work.

# Portfolio
I will populate this section of the page with links to different projects as the course progresses.

## Data Visualization Critique #2: New Housing Production in 2017
<script id="infogram_0_4fc6ac39-3df9-4602-ad0b-9d050107dc79" title="New Housing Production in 2017" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?YSp" type="text/javascript"></script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/4fc6ac39-3df9-4602-ad0b-9d050107dc79" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">New Housing Production in 2017</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

I chose to remake a visualization from the Joint Housing Studies Center of Harvard University (JCHS)'s ["State of the Nation's Housing 2018" report](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Harvard_JCHS_State_of_the_Nations_Housing_2018.pdf). Specifically, I worked to recreate Figure 8, which is located on Page 8. The data table used by JCHS to generate that graphic is referred to as Table A-1 in the report and can be found on Pages 38 and 39. I used the same data to build my alternate data visualization.

I read a lot of the various reports, policy papers, data tables, and other findings that JHSC regularly for my job. While I find JCHS' work to be tremendously valuable, I'm nevertheless routinely see lackluster graphics and visualizations peppered throughout the Center's work. Figure 8 is an appropriate case-in-point: It is, for all intents and purposes, just a trimmed down version of Table A-1.

Allow to explain in greater detail. Table A-1 is effectively a very large data set formatted as a wide data table. All of the information included as part of this data table is correct, accessible, and organized, but it's horribly boring. It's a fantastic resource of great utility to be included in the appendix of the report, but there's little reason for Figure 8 to be presented in largely the same aesthetic manner elsewhere in the document. Speaking bluntly, Figure 8 is just the data table of Table A-1 but trimmed down to only include select data from the years 2016 and 2017. And, as we discussed in class, a table — even a stale, boring one — counts as a data visualization.

I felt that this could be improved upon with an almost wholesale reformation of the visualization. Figure 8 is located early on in Section 2: Housing Markets. The subsections for the first few pages of this part of the report are used to discuss trends and adherence to relative forecasts within the housing sector. I took this into consideration when formulating my recreation of Figure 8, and thus selected to use my new Figure 8 to point out a few data points of note rather than dozens of them, as the graphic's previous and original iteration did.

Much of the content and general thrust of what's conveyed using the original Figure 8 is spelled out elsewhere in the report in the form of text. Additionally, as has been noted, Table A-1 is available as part of the report's appendix. So, I wanted to place emphasis on a few noteworthy trends in particular within the data from 2017 that I pulled out of Table A-1 via Figure 8. My goal was to create a more engaging and appealing data visualization than a reader could find in the document at the moment while still sharing valuable information about the trends in the housing sector discussed in the adjacent paragraphs of text.


## OIG Data Visualization #1
### Part 1: Crowded & Cramped
<script id="infogram_0_4b74d6a1-b1fd-4dcd-93ca-d33f98a84d57" title="Crowded &amp;amp;amp; Cramped" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?na3" type="text/javascript"></script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/4b74d6a1-b1fd-4dcd-93ca-d33f98a84d57" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Crowded & Cramped</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

With this data visualization, produced from the perspective of a data journalist, I wanted the images to do most of the talking. To that end, I selected visualization tools that were pronounced and larger than some other forms of content would have. The bar charts make it immediately clear that the numbers of detainees have grown significantly across the different classification types, and its large size catches the reader's eye quite quickly. The icon selection of a human body for the children being detained for longer than the time period permissible by federal regulations creates a stark association. 

I tried to use a color scheme that would enduce a menancing feel, so I selected paler tones of white and grey for text and graphs. I wasn't happy with the selection of a base color for the background and instead wanted to pair the background image with the overall tone of the project, so I was able to find a disturbing and discomforting photo of a barbed wire fence in a cooler color palette that I felt worked well with the aforementioned white and grey in a complementary manner.

The intended audience would be readers who would find the contents of the OIG report alarming, but who may not find themselves reading a federal report. With that I mind, I tried to generate a visualization that would drive home just how unsettling the conditions described therein are while also still grabbing a reader's attention and holding it.


### Part 2: Dramatic Increases in 2019 Detentions
<script id="infogram_0_e6edbbff-acdc-4d40-a016-b81c76fb3f9a" title="Dramatic Increases in 2019 Detensions" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?zMU" type="text/javascript"></script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/e6edbbff-acdc-4d40-a016-b81c76fb3f9a" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Dramatic Increases in 2019 Detensions</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

This data visualization is produced from the perspective of a DHS analyst. I found this aspect of the assignment significantly harder because I had to balance the desire to make something eye-catching with the need to restrain myself from making something that might be considered too "arty" for the situation. The intended audience is, as noted in the instructions, policymakers within the federal government. Knowing that, I set out to focus the data visualization's contents on the statistics that the OIG report provided to describe the degree to which these facilities were overcrowded because of the large surge in apprehensions. I tried to use the callouts with percentages as the primary means of associating bigger picture numeric values with the more detailed blurbs to their right, followed by a different type of graphic — without repeating any — then located further to the right once more.

Selecting a color scheme proved to be difficult. I was worried that mimicking the OIG's color scheme of red, white, and blue (ish) would be a safe bet for any federal agency, but my first attempt at doing so looked far too lame and hokey. I ultimately wound up going with a middle-of-the-road blend of earth tones that I felt seemed appropriate for a visualization on federal activities around the Southern Border, and that would still stand out on a possibly otherwise white background of a report page.
