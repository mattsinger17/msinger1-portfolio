This is the public portfolio that I plan to use for the course Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About Me
My name is Matt Singer and the pronouns that I use are he, him, and his. I'm in the MPM program here at Heinz with a projected graduation in December 2019 â€” close enough to be eager, but still far away enough to have to deal with one last required core course. I've tried to maintain a focus on public and urban policy thus far in my coursework in the MPM program.

I work as the Legislative Director for the Office of City Councilman Corey O'Connor, where I specialize in policy research, analysis, and management. In this public-facing role representing the City Council office and O'Connor, I'm charged with executing special projects and legislative initiatives. I brief Council Members and staff, department representatives, and external constituencies on the details of policy initiatives, including many bills that are routed through the City Council Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, which O'Connor chairs, while building, growing, and maintaining stakeholder relationships that support the successful implementation of O'Connor's and City Council's policy agenda.

I'm sure that this description of myself sounds quite boring, but I promise that I'm not a dour downer. In my spare time, I enjoy baking at home, as well as leaning into my newly-acquired brand as a millennial cat dad with my pet, Lucy, who I adopted over the winter. :cat2:

# What I Hope to Learn
Despite fairing incredibly well when dealing with dense or arcane subject matter, I've often struggled to translate that information into a highly-communicable medium like data visualization. Further complicating that situation is the reality that I'm not particularly gifted at generating aesthetically-pleasing digital content. Therefore, I think that this class will be an engaging way to develop a skill set that I've long desired: the ability to share self-made visuals for relevant projects.

I'm eager to learn the ropes of data visualization, from the basics of color theory to the more mechanical specifics of the practice. I'd like to be able to walk away from this course with the competancies necessary to plan, design, create, and share my own data visualizations for a variety of purposes, including in my professional work.

# Portfolio
I will populate this section of the page with links to different projects as the course progresses.
