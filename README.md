This is the public portfolio that I plan to use for the course Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About Me
My name is Matt Singer and the pronouns that I use are he, him, and his. I'm in the MPM program here at Heinz with a projected graduation in December 2019 â€” close enough to be eager, but still far away enough to have to deal with one last required core course. I've tried to maintain a focus on public and urban policy thus far in my coursework in the MPM program.

I work as the Legislative Director for the Office of City Councilman Corey O'Connor, where I specialize in policy research, analysis, and management. In this public-facing role representing the City Council office and O'Connor, I'm charged with executing special projects and legislative initiatives. I brief Council Members and staff, department representatives, and external constituencies on the details of policy initiatives, including many bills that are routed through the City Council Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, which O'Connor chairs, while building, growing, and maintaining stakeholder relationships that support the successful implementation of O'Connor's and City Council's policy agenda.
